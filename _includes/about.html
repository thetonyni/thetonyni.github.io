      Hello! My name is Amanda and I’m a current master’s student in the inaugural class of the <b><a href="https://datascience.virginia.edu/">University of Virginia School of Data 
      Science</a></b>. Prior to the program, I attended the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, where I graduated with high honors in economics and a minor in mathematics, 
      studied abroad as a Gilman Scholar in Beijing, interned for the Ministry of Economic Development in Albania, trained and competed internationally in
      taekwondo, and held various jobs including as a Research Assistant and Data Visualization Consultant. In my free time, I publish articles to Medium's
     <a href="https://medium.com/@amawest"><i>Towards Data Science</i></a> publication.

      The spark in me for programming ignited the first time a teacher taught me how to use my knowledge of matrix algebra to populate and loop through a vector.
      It was stoked everytime I picked up a new language (R, C++, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MATLAB) and molded the code for projects in physics, 
      UX/UI design, machine-learning, NLP, or geospatial data visualization, to name a few. Everytime I jumped from my seat, ecstatic that a null hypothesis
      could be rejected or my confusion matrix had a particularly low false positive rate, my passion for programming and for data science was stoked further.

      <br>
      <br> 
     
      My qualitative skills include written and oral communication, leadership experience, creative problem-solving, and team management; I’m excited to 
      find employment (May 2021) that will help me further hone my skills with data and creative analysis. Thanks for reading about me today!
