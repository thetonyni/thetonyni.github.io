    Hi! My name's Amanda West and I'm a current masters student at the
    <b><a href="https://datascience.virginia.edu/">University of Virginia School of Data 
    Science</a></b>.
    
    As an undergraduate, my focus was in <b>economic policy</b> and <b>mathematics</b>, 
    and I am most interested in seeing how public entities can improve decision making 
    processes through data science. This particularly relates to development and alleviating
    poverty at home and abroad. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I love to hike, read historical fiction novels with a warm beverage, 
    experiment with my beloved espresso maker, and travel (and record it all in 
    my <a href="https://postcardsfromthefadedblue.wordpress.com/">ongoing travel blog</a>.
    Disclaimer: the articles talk a LOT about coffee). I love self expression of all forms, 
    and get no better rush than when I've created a beautiful new data visualization or 
    make a chunk of code work perfectly. 
    
    If you think I would be a good fit for your company, want to grab a coffee (my treat!), 
    or just want to drop tips on future travel destinations, you can reach me
    at amawest@umich.edu. Looking forward to our chat!
